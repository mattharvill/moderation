At Hinge we're here to change dating culture by providing a place where you can reliably find your next relationship among people who are on the same page and who treat each other with kindness and respect.

We believe the Hinge Team Must:
Prioritize Safety
Hinge Daters should feel safe to be who they are; safe to match with whoever interests them; safe to plan whatever type of date they’re comfortable with.

We’ll take a proactive stance to build tools, features, and incorporate resources to help our daters stay informed and feeling safe. Resources should be intuitive, clear, and easy to navigate.

We always want our community to feel secure and that we’re protecting them against known threats while empowering them to alert us to any and all unknown community threats we’re not yet aware of.

 

Err on the Side of Caution
In order to foster a safe place to date, we must act on reports swiftly. When alerted, we will take action to help ensure Hinge Daters are protected. 

 We’ll welcome and consider relevant information and facts when making a decision. When necessary, we’ll reach out for more information-- this isn't meant to be invalidating, but to help us resolve, understand, and troubleshoot. The more information we have the better we are able to check our bias and enforce our safety values. We keep your report private and will never share that information with the people you’ve reported

 

Check our Biases
The social environment is dynamic, and our policy, tools, and rules should reflect as such. Our initiatives, protocols, and policy will be reviewed routinely and regularly. 

What will never change, however, is our commitment to building a community of authentic, courageous, empathetic daters. We believe in love for all.

Our focus is on creating a climate on Hinge of inclusivity and inclusion. This means supporting and rewarding an empathetic community where everyone feels safe to be their authentic selves. Our attention will be on matters pertaining to the safety, security, and integrity of the Hinge Community.

 

Not act as arbiters of truth
We want Hinge Daters to have information about potential matches so they can reach out to others with mutual beliefs and opinions. We aren’t here to make decisions on what is fact and fiction, but we are responsible to work to ensure our users are not putting others in jeopardy or inflicting harm

 

Listen
Should a Hinge Dater reach out to us for support, they should expect to hear back from our team. If Hinge Daters have a feature request or an idea to improve the app experience, we want to know. If Hinge Daters need resources and support, we are here to help in every capacity we can, including connecting you to resources and services that can provide help from trained specialists. If you were banned and worry it may be a result of retaliatory behavior or false reporting, we encourage you to appeal.

 

Foster A Community Built on Trust & Respect
We have a responsibility to the community to provide a safe place for people to find meaningful relationships. Users trust us with their personal information and we will respect that in how we build our tools and services. We do not discuss the existence or the status or details of an account with anyone but the account owner.

 

Step in When Necessary
We're here to step in when something or someone poses a threat of physical, emotional, or psychological harm to another

Our team is committed to working with law enforcement as appropriate and responding to valid law enforcement requests.

We take suicide and self-injury extremely seriously and will work to help members of this community in crisis.

 

 

We Expect The Hinge Community To:
Be Open to Others
We are building a diverse and welcoming community. This may mean you see opinions that differ from your own. We encourage Hinge Daters to respect the opinions of others, even when they don't agree with them, and simply skip or remove users they aren't interested in. Commenting or matching with someone with the sole intention of antagonizing them for their beliefs is misaligned with our values of empathy and kindness

 

Understand Consent is Critical
Consent must be clearly and freely communicated. 

Consent can be both expressly granted and revoked. Consent can also be implied. There is an implied expectation in Discover that Hinge members will not promote physical, emotional, and psychological abuse, harm, harassment, hate, or discrimination. This includes sexual advances, comments, and imagery. 

Posting content to your profile or initiating a conversation that is crude, lewd, or offensive is not acceptable behavior

 

Respect Boundaries
Hinge Daters should not reach out to users outside of Hinge unless they have communicated that it is appropriate to do so. 

Seeing someone on Hinge is not an invitation to interact with them through social media. If someone unmatched you on Hinge, the next step is to respect their choice, not find them on social media.

 

Be Honest
Hinge Daters don’t need to add a surname, but you should not provide a false name or date of birth, maintain duplicate accounts, or create an account if you’re under 18. Deceiving others about your age or posting misleading or outdated photos is misaligned with our values of honesty and authenticity and unfair to the Hinge community.

Hinge profiles are curated to showcase your personality, interests, and criteria about yourself. This should be a holistic view into who you are, so folks can get a good snapshot into what you’re like. We respect boundaries-- Hinge Daters can showcase their passion, and humor in ways that are authentic, courageous, and kind to other members in Discover.

 

Put in Effort
Hinge Daters don’t mind putting a little effort into their dating life because they’re invested in finding someone great. They are not afraid to put themselves out there by authentically representing who they are - quirks and all. 
The more intention you put into your Hinge profile, the better your experience will be. We understand not everyone loves every photo of themselves, however it’s difficult for others to get to know you if your profile is mostly composed of memes or gibberish prompts. Your matches want to know the real you.

 

Seek Meaningful Relationships
Are you looking for a reaction or a connection? Hinge daters are looking for a meaningful relationship, so be cognizant of what and how you choose to both share information about yourself, and how you ask for information you’re hoping to learn about them. 

We have created a space for people to find meaningful relationships. A meaningful relationship is built on a foundation of authenticity, transparency, and respect. We ask that Hinge Daters represent themselves authentically, represent their intentions transparently, and treat all respectfully.

We respect and honor the many forms a meaningful relationship can take. We know there are many different relationship styles, preferences, kinks, and personal needs in a partner.

We respect you and welcome you, provided you’re honest and empathetic about what you’re looking for, and not soliciting or behaving in criminal acts.
