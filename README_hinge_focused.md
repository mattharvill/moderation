# Dating App Moderation That Doesn't Kill User Engagement

## The Problem Every Dating App Faces
**Standard AI moderation treats dating apps like Twitter** - flagging "Want to grab coffee?" as harassment and "You're beautiful" as inappropriate. Result? **Users get frustrated and leave.**

**The business impact:**
- Over-moderation reduces user engagement
- High false positive rates increase support tickets
- Appeal processes waste time and money
- Users abandon apps that feel "censored"

## The Solution: Context-Aware Moderation

I built an AI moderation system specifically designed for dating app conversations. **The key insight: dating apps need progressive enforcement, not zero-tolerance policies.**

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Features

**Progressive Enforcement Framework**
- "First speeding ticket" approach - educate before punishing
- Hook-up language scored appropriately (2-3, not violation-level 8-9)
- Context awareness: "You're hot" between matched users â‰  harassment

**Dual-Prompt Architecture**
- **General prompt:** Handles 90% of dating app content with nuanced scoring
- **Specialized prompt:** Routes critical content (self-harm, hate speech, fraud) to appropriate handling

**Crisis Intervention (Not Punishment)**
- Self-harm detection triggers support resources, not content removal
- Mental health specialist escalation
- Receiver guidance: "This person may be experiencing a crisis..."

**Smart Content Routing**
- Automatic detection of critical vs. everyday content
- Different handling for different severity levels
- Maintains user experience while ensuring safety

## Systematic Evaluation Methodology

**Human-Centered Validation**
- 45+ manually annotated traces across 4 evaluation dimensions
- Systematic tagging for false positive pattern identification
- Langfuse observability for production monitoring

**Key Insights Discovered:**
- 33% false positive rate reduced through dating app context calibration
- "Severity inflation" biggest issue - borderline content scored as violations
- Progressive enforcement maintains safety while improving user experience

**Pattern Analysis:**
- `fp_severity_inflation`: 6 cases identified and optimized
- `accurate_appropriate`: 19 cases validating context-aware approach
- Systematic prompt optimization based on real failure modes

## Business Impact Focus

**Cost Optimization:**
- RAG architecture planned for 70% token cost reduction
- Reduced manual review requirements through better automation
- Lower appeal rates through more accurate initial decisions

**User Experience:**
- Dating-appropriate language no longer flagged as violations
- Progressive warnings vs. immediate bans
- Support-focused crisis intervention

**Scalability:**
- Production-ready observability with Langfuse integration
- A/B testing infrastructure for prompt optimization
- Systematic evaluation framework for continuous improvement

## Technical Implementation

**AI/ML Stack:**
- GPT-4/GPT-4V with Chain of Thought reasoning
- Dual-prompt system with intelligent content routing
- Real Hinge community guidelines integration

**Evaluation & Monitoring:**
- Langfuse tracing for every moderation decision
- Human annotation workflow for ground truth validation
- Automated accuracy calculation and pattern identification

**Demo Interface:**
- Streamlit web interface for stakeholder presentations
- Multi-modal support (text and image content)
- Real-time content analysis with full reasoning transparency

**Test these scenarios:**
1. **"Hey! Want to grab coffee?"** â†’ Appropriate (Score: 1)
2. **"What's your phone number?"** â†’ Context-dependent scoring
3. **"You're beautiful"** â†’ Dating-appropriate compliment
4. **"I want to kill myself"** â†’ Crisis intervention (not punishment)

## Why This Matters for Dating Apps

**Traditional moderation assumes malicious intent. Dating apps need systems that understand romantic conversation context.**

Key differentiators:
- Progressive enforcement builds user trust
- Context-aware scoring reduces false positives
- Crisis intervention prioritizes user welfare
- Systematic evaluation enables continuous improvement

## Next Steps

**Ready for Production:**
- Dual-prompt architecture with 100% routing accuracy
- Human evaluation methodology established
- Cost optimization roadmap documented
- Crisis intervention protocols tested

**Scaling Opportunities:**
- Video content moderation extension
- Multi-language support
- Integration with user behavioral patterns
- Advanced fraud detection capabilities
