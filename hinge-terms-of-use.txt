California subscribers: You may cancel your subscription, without penalty or obligation, at any

subscribed using an External Service (e.g., Apple ID, Google Play), you must cancel through
your External Service, as set forth in more detail in Section 8a. If you subscribed through your

through your Apple ID account on your phone or at https://getsupport.apple.com. All other users
may request a refund by contacting Hinge Customer Service at hello@hinge.co, or by mailing or
delivering a signed and dated notice that states that you, the buyer, are canceling this agreement,
or words of similar effect. Please also include your name and the email address, phone number,
or other unique identifier you used to sign up for your account.
This notice shall be sent to: Hinge, Attn: Cancellations, P.O. Box 25472, Dallas, Texas 75225,

We have included brief summaries at the beginning of each section to make it easier for you to
read and understand this agreement. The summaries do not replace the text of each section,
and you should still read each section in its entirety.
1. INTRODUCTION
By accessing or using Hinge's Services, you agree to be bound by this Terms of Use
Agreement (the “Terms” or “Agreement”), including our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy,
Member Principles, and Safety Dating Advice, so it is important that you read this Agreement

in the immediate suspension or termination of your account.
3. CONTENT
It is important that you understand your rights and responsibilities with regard to the content
on our Services, including any content you provide or post. You are expressly prohibited from
posting inappropriate content.
While using our Services, you will have access to: (i) content that you upload or provide while
using our Services, even if suggested by our Services ("Your Content"); (ii) content that other
users upload or provide while using our Services ("Member Content"); and (iii) content that
Hinge provides on and through our Services ("Our Content"). In this agreement, "content"
includes, without limitation, all text, images, video, audio, or other material on our Services,
including information on users' profiles and in direct messages between users.
3a. YOUR CONTENT
You are responsible for Your Content. Don't share anything that you wouldn't want others to
see, that would violate this Agreement, or that may expose you or us to legal liability.
You are solely responsible and liable for Your Content, and, therefore, you agree to indemnify,
defend, release, and hold us harmless from any claims made in connection with Your Content.
You represent and warrant to us that the information you provide to us or any other user is
accurate, including any information submitted through third-party sources (if applicable),
and that you will update your account information as necessary to ensure its accuracy.
The content included on your individual profile should be relevant to the intended use of our
Services. You may not upload any Prohibited Content, and your content must further comply
with the Member Principles. You may not display any personal contact, banking or
peer-to-peer payment information, whether in relation to you or any other person (for
example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs,
credit/debit card, peer-to-peer payment user name, or other banking details). If you choose to
reveal any personal information about yourself to other users, you do so at your own risk.
We strongly encourage you to use caution in disclosing any personal information online.
Your individual profile will be visible to other people around the world, so be sure that you
are comfortable sharing Your Content before you post. You acknowledge and agree that Your
Content may be viewed by other users, and, notwithstanding these Terms, other users may
share Your Content with third parties. By uploading Your Content, you represent and warrant
to us that you have all necessary rights and licenses to do so and automatically grant us a
license to use Your Content as provided under Section 7 below.
We may provide tools and features to enhance individual expression through Your Content and
Member Content (described in Section 3b), and we’re constantly developing new technologies to
improve our Services. Certain tools or features may allow you to generate or enhance content
based on Your Content. This is still Your Content, and you are responsible for it and its accuracy,
as well as your use of it on our Services and any and all decisions made, actions taken, and
failures to take action based on Your Content. Be careful in choosing and sharing Your Content.
You understand and agree that we may analyze, access, store, and use Your Content, including
messages and other communications, to monitor, develop, personalize, and improve our
Services, including through the use of machine learning and other automated technologies, in
accordance with applicable law.
You understand and agree that we may monitor or review Your Content, and we have the right to
remove, delete, edit, limit, or block or prevent access to any of Your Content at any time at our
sole discretion. If Your Content is prohibited under the laws of any jurisdiction where our
Services are available, we may remove it even if it is not illegal in your location. Furthermore,
you understand and agree that we have no obligation to display or review Your Content.
3b. MEMBER CONTENT
While you will have access to Member Content, it is not yours and you may not copy or
use Member Content for any purpose except as contemplated by these Terms.
Other users will also share content on our Services. Member Content belongs to the user who
posted the content and is stored on our servers and displayed at the direction of that user.
You should always carefully review and independently verify Member Content for accuracy.
Other users may use tools to generate or enhance content based on the Member Content they
provide. Member Content may include biased, incorrect, harmful, offensive, or misleading
information. Other users are responsible for their Member Content, as well as any and all
decisions made, actions taken, and failures to take action based on their use of Member Content.
You do not have any rights in relation to Member Content, and, unless expressly authorized by
Hinge, you may only use Member Content to the extent that your use is consistent with our
Services' purpose of allowing you to communicate with and meet one another. You may not
copy the Member Content or use Member Content for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass,
or to make unlawful threats. We reserve the right to terminate your account if you misuse
Member Content.
3c. OUR CONTENT
Hinge owns all other content on our Services.
Any other text, content, graphics, user interfaces, trademarks, logos, sounds, artwork, images,
and other intellectual property appearing on our Services is owned, controlled or licensed by us
and protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property law rights. All rights, title,
and interest in and to Our Content remains with us at all times.
We grant you a limited license to access and use Our Content as provided under Section 6 below,
and we reserve all other rights.
4. INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT AND MISCONDUCT; REPORTING
Hinge does not tolerate inappropriate content or behavior on our Services.
We are committed to maintaining a positive and respectful Hinge community, and we do not
tolerate any inappropriate content or misconduct, whether on or off of the Services (including,
but not limited to, on services operated by our affiliates). We encourage you to report any
inappropriate Member Content or misconduct by other users. You can report a user directly by
tapping the three dots in the top right of any profile and selecting “Report”. You may also
submit a report by clicking here.
As set forth in our Privacy Policy, we may share data between our affiliates for the safety and
security of our users and may take necessary actions if we believe you have violated these
Terms, including banning you from our Services and/or our affiliates’ services (such as Tinder,
OkCupid, Match, Meetic, BLK, LoveScout24, OurTime, and Pairs; for more details, click
here), and/or preventing you from creating new accounts. You understand and agree that we
may not share information with you regarding your account, including the reason for your
account ban, if doing so would potentially impair the safety or privacy of our other users.
Member Content is subject to the terms and conditions of Sections 512(c) and/or 512(d) of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998. To submit a complaint regarding Member Content that
may constitute intellectual property infringement, see Section 12 (Digital Millennium Copyright
Act) below.
We use a combination of automated tools and human reviewers to enforce our content rules.
This includes technology that proactively detects and removes certain types of prohibited
material. We also encourage users to report any inappropriate content they encounter. Our
systems and processes are generally designed to prioritize the detection and removal of the most
serious and harmful violations (e.g., child sexual exploitation material or terrorist content), even
if instances of such content are rare. For additional information on how we moderate content,
please see our Safety page.
Violations may result in consequences ranging from a warning for a less serious infraction to
banning the account for more serious or repeated violations. For example, manifestly illegal and
harmful content such as terrorist content or child sexual exploitation material will result in a
ban. If you believe Your Content was removed in error, you may submit an appeal. More
information is available here.
Manifestly unfounded reports may result in enforcement actions against the reporter. In
assessing misuse, we consider factors such as evidence that a report was motivated by bias or
hatred (e.g., based on protected characteristics such as race, sexual orientation, or gender
identity) or other malicious intent. Repeated submission of manifestly unfounded reports will
result in a ban.
5. PRIVACY
Privacy is important to us. We have a separate policy about it that you agree to read.
For information about how Hinge and its affiliates collect, use, and share your personal data,
please read our Privacy Policy. By using our Services, you agree that we may use your personal
data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
6. RIGHTS YOU ARE GRANTED BY HINGE
Hinge grants you the right to use and enjoy our Services, subject to these Terms.
For as long as you comply with these Terms, Hinge grants you a personal, worldwide,
royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access
and use our Services for purposes as intended by Hinge and permitted by these Terms and
applicable laws. This license and any authorization to access the Service are automatically
revoked in the event that you fail to comply with these Terms.
7. RIGHTS YOU GRANT HINGE
You own all of the content you provide to Hinge, but you also grant us the right to use Your
Content as provided in this Agreement.
By creating an account, you grant to Hinge a worldwide, perpetual, transferable, sub-licensable,
royalty-free right and license to host, store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish,
translate, modify, reformat, incorporate into other works, advertise, distribute and otherwise
make available to the general public Your Content, including any information you authorize us to
access from third- party sources (if applicable), in whole or in part, and in any way and in any
format or medium currently known or developed in the future. Hinge's license to Your Content
shall be non-exclusive, except that Hinge's license shall be exclusive with respect to derivative
works created through use of our Services. For example, Hinge would have an exclusive license
to screenshots of our Services that include Your Content. In addition, so that Hinge can prevent
the use of Your Content outside of our Services, you authorize Hinge to act on your behalf with
respect to infringing uses of Your Content taken from our Services by other users or third parties.
This expressly includes the authority, but not the obligation, to send notices pursuant to 17
U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown Notices) on your behalf if Your Content is taken and
used by third parties outside of our Services. Hinge is not obligated to take any action with
regard to use of Your Content by other users or third parties. Hinge's license to Your Content is
subject to your rights under applicable law (for example, laws regarding personal data protection
to the extent the content contains personal information as defined by those laws).
In consideration for Hinge allowing you to use our Services, you agree that we, our affiliates,
and our third-party partners may place advertising on our Services. By submitting suggestions or
feedback to Hinge regarding our Services, you agree that Hinge may use and share such
feedback for any purpose without compensating you.
You agree that Hinge may access, preserve, and disclose your account information, including
Your Content, if required to do so by law or upon a good faith belief that such access,
preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce
these Terms; (iii) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (iv)
respond to your requests for customer service; (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety
of the Company or any other person, or (vi) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding
illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.
8. PURCHASES AND AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTIONS
You will have the opportunity to purchase features and services from Hinge. If you purchase a
subscription, it will automatically renew - and you will be charged - until you cancel.
Hinge may offer features and services for purchase through the Apple App Store, Google Play
Store, or other external services authorized by Hinge (each, an "External Service," and any
purchases made thereon, an "External Service Purchase"). Hinge may also offer features and
services for purchase via credit card or other payment processors on the Website or linked inside
the App ("Internal Purchases"). If you purchase a subscription, it will automatically renew until
you cancel, in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase, as further
described below. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to your
subscription benefits until the end of your subscription period, at which point it will expire.
However, if you terminate your Hinge membership by deleting your Hinge account as set forth
in Section 9, and you have an Internal Purchase that includes an automatically renewing
subscription, your subscription will be canceled immediately when you delete your Hinge
account and you will permanently lose access to any remaining subscription benefits for your
then-current subscription. If you decide to create a new Hinge account during the original
subscription period, you will not be able to reaccess your subscription benefits and will need to
purchase a new subscription.
Because our Services may be utilized without a subscription, canceling your subscription does not
remove your profile from our Services. If you wish to fully terminate your membership, you must
terminate your membership as set forth in Section 9.
Hinge operates a global business, and our pricing varies based on a number of factors. We
frequently offer promotional rates - which can vary based on region, length of subscription,
bundle size, past purchases, account activity, and more. We also regularly test new features and
payment options. In the event of a price change, we will attempt to notify you in advance of the
change by sending an email and/or other communication message to the contact information you
have registered for your account. If you do not wish to accept a price change for a renewing
subscription, you may cancel your subscription in accordance with the instructions included in
that communication and below. If you do not timely cancel your subscription, your subscription
will be renewed at the full price as indicated when the purchase was made, without any
additional action by you, and you authorize us to charge your payment method for these
amounts. To the extent permissible by law, we reserve the right, including without prior notice,
to limit the available quantity of or discontinue making available any feature, service or other
offering; to impose conditions on the honoring of any coupon, discount, offer or other
promotion; to bar any user from making any transaction; and to refuse to provide any user with
any feature, service or other offering.
8a. EXTERNAL SERVICE PURCHASES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS
External Service Purchases, including subscriptions, may be processed through the External
Service (such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store), in which case those purchases
must be managed through your External Service Account. Subscriptions automatically
renew until you cancel.
When making a purchase on the Service, you may have the option to pay through an External
Service, such as with your Apple ID or Google Play account ("your External Service
Account"), and your External Service Account will be charged for the purchase in accordance
with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase and the general terms applicable to your
External Service Account. Some External Services may charge you sales tax, depending on
where you live, which may change from time to time.
If your External Service Purchase includes an automatically renewing subscription, your
External Service Account will continue to be periodically charged for the subscription until
you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent
subscription period, the subscription will automatically continue for the price and time period
you agreed to when subscribing. If you received a discounted promotional offer, your price
may go up per the terms of that offer following the initial subscription period for any
subsequent renewal period.
To cancel a subscription: If you do not want your subscription to renew automatically, or if you
want to change or terminate your subscription, you must log in to your External Service Account
and follow instructions to manage or cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise
deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the App from your device. For example, if
you subscribed using your Apple ID, cancellation is handled by Apple, not Hinge. To cancel a
purchase made with your Apple ID, go to Settings > [click on your Apple Account at the top of
the page] > Subscriptions, then find your Hinge subscription and follow the instructions to
cancel. You can also request assistance at https://getsupport.apple.com. Similarly, if you
subscribed on Google Play, cancellation is handled by Google. To cancel a purchase made
through Google Play, launch the Google Play app on your mobile device and go to Account >
Payments & Subscriptions > Subscriptions, then find your Hinge subscription and follow the
instructions to cancel. You can also request assistance at https://play.google.com. If you cancel a
subscription, you may continue to use the cancelled subscription until the end of your
then-current subscription term. The subscription will not be renewed when your then-current
term expires.
If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your External Service
Account, Hinge may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion, on the basis that
you have determined that you do not want a Hinge subscription. In the event that your
chargeback or other payment reversal is overturned, please contact Customer Care. Hinge will
retain all funds charged to your External Service Account until you cancel your subscription
through your External Service Account.
Certain users may be entitled to request a refund. See Section 8d below for more information.
8b. INTERNAL PURCHASES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS
Internal Purchases, including Hinge payments powered by Stripe, are processed using the
Payment Method you provide on the Website or linked in the App. Subscriptions
automatically renew until you cancel.
If you make an Internal Purchase, you agree to pay the prices displayed to you for the Services
you've selected as well as any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your payments (and
as may change from time to time), and you authorize Hinge to charge the payment method you
provide (your "Payment Method"). Hinge may correct any billing errors or mistakes even if we
have already requested or received payment. If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a
payment made with your Payment Method, Hinge may terminate your account immediately in
its sole discretion, on the basis that you have determined that you do not want a Hinge
subscription. In the event that your chargeback or other payment reversal is overturned, please
contact Customer Service at hello@hinge.com.
If your Internal Purchase includes an automatically renewing subscription, your Payment
Method will continue to be periodically charged for the subscription until you cancel. After
your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription
period, your subscription will automatically continue for the price and time period you agreed
to when subscribing, until you cancel. If you received a discounted promotional offer, your
price may go up per the terms of that offer following the initial subscription period for any
subsequent renewal period.
To cancel a subscription, log in to the Website or App and go to the Account Settings section
and follow the instructions to cancel. If you cancel a subscription, you may continue to use
the canceled subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term. The
subscription will not be renewed when your then-current term expires. However, if you
terminate your Hinge membership by deleting your Hinge account as set forth in Section 9,
and you have an automatically renewing subscription, your subscription will be canceled
immediately when you delete your Hinge account and you will permanently lose access to
any remaining subscription benefits for your then-current subscription. If you decide to
create a new Hinge account during the original subscription period, you will not be able to
reaccess your subscription benefits and will need to purchase a new subscription.
You may edit your Payment Method information by using the Account Settings tool and
clicking “Manage Subscription”. If a payment is not successfully processed, due to
expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, you remain responsible for any uncollected
amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated.
This may result in a change to your payment billing dates.
In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card
numbers for your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer. The terms
of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements
between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer, or other provider of your chosen
Payment Method. If you reside outside of the Americas, you agree that your payment to Hinge
may be through MTCH Technology Services Limited, and if you reside in the Americas, that
your payment to Hinge may be through Hinge, Inc. Certain users may be entitled to request a
refund. See Section 8d below for more information.
8c. VIRTUAL ITEMS
Virtual items are non-refundable and subject to certain conditions.
From time to time, you may have the opportunity to purchase a limited, personal,
non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use or access special limited-use features
including but not limited to credits redeemable on virtual items, such as a Rose or Boost ("Virtual
Item(s)") from Hinge. You may only purchase Virtual Items from us or our authorized partners
through our Services.
Virtual Items represent a limited license right governed by this Agreement, and, except as
otherwise prohibited by applicable law, no title or ownership in or to Virtual Items is being
transferred or assigned to you. This Agreement should not be construed as a sale of any rights in
Virtual Items.
Any Virtual Item balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or
reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license.
Virtual Items do not incur fees for non-use; however, the license granted to you in Virtual Items
will terminate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, on the earlier of when Hinge
ceases providing our Services, or your account is otherwise closed or terminated.
Hinge, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual
Items and/or may distribute Virtual Items with or without charge. Hinge may manage, regulate,
control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, including taking actions that may impact
the perceived value or purchase price, if applicable, of any Virtual Items. Hinge shall have no
liability to you or any third party in the event that Hinge exercises any such rights. The transfer
of Virtual Items is prohibited, and you shall not sell, redeem, or otherwise transfer Virtual Items
to any person or entity. Virtual Items may only be redeemed through our Services.
ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH OUR
SERVICES ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
HINGE IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR VIRTUAL ITEMS FOR ANY
REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION
FOR ANY UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER
SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY (SUCH AS THROUGH AN
ACCOUNT BAN).
8d. REFUNDS
Generally, all purchases are nonrefundable. Special terms apply in Arizona, California,
Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode
Island, Wisconsin, and the EU, EEA, UK, Israel, and Switzerland.
Generally, all purchases are final and nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for
partially used or unused subscription periods or Virtual Items, except if the laws applicable
in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.
For subscribers residing in the EU, EEA, UK, and Switzerland:
In accordance with local law, you are entitled to a full refund during the 14 days after the
subscription begins. Please note that this 14-day period commences when the subscription starts.
For subscribers residing in Germany:
You may terminate your subscription after it has renewed with a notice period of one
month. Your right to terminate for cause remains unaffected.
For subscribers residing in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois,
Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and
Israel:
Your Right to Cancel - You may cancel your subscription, without penalty or obligation, at any
time prior to midnight of the third business day following the date you subscribed. In the event
that you die before the end of your subscription period, your estate shall be entitled to a refund
of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the
period after your death. In the event that you become disabled (such that you are unable to use
our Services) before the end of your subscription period, you shall be entitled to a refund of that
portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after
your disability by providing the Company notice in the same manner as you request a refund as
described below.
Purchases of Virtual Items are FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.
If any of the above apply to you and you subscribed using your Apple ID, your refund requests
are handled by Apple, not Hinge. To request a refund, please contact your External Service
directly; for example using your Apple device, go to reportaproblem.apple.com and tap or click
"I'd like to," then choose "Request a refund." You can also request a refund at
https://getsupport.apple.com. For any other purchase, please contact Hinge Customer Service
with your order number (see your confirmation email) by mailing or delivering a signed and
dated notice which states that you, the buyer, are canceling this Agreement, or words of similar
effect. Please also include the email address or telephone number associated with your account
along with your order number. This notice shall be sent to:
Hinge, Attn: Cancellations,
P.O. Box 25472,
Dallas, Texas 75225, USA (California and Ohio users may also email Hinge
Customer Service at hello@hinge.co, or send a facsimile to 972-892-9570).
8e. INSTALLMENT PLAN CONDITIONS
If you agree to make a purchase pursuant to the installment plan option,
your purchase will be subject to these additional terms and conditions,
including for eligibility, payment, and cancellation.
By selecting the option to pay in four payments and clicking subscribe, in
addition to the terms set forth above, you agree to the following additional terms
that will govern your installment plan purchase:
1. Eligibility. To be eligible, you must be a Hinge member in good standing.
This offer may not be available to every customer and may not be
available for all Services Hinge offers. Hinge will not use a consumer
credit report to determine your eligibility for this Agreement.
2. Payment. You authorize Hinge to charge the Payment Method selected on
a periodic basis (as determined when you register). You will be charged
the full price of the qualifying feature or service you selected spread
equally over one initial payment due at the time of purchase and three
subsequent payments (provided, however, that if the full price is not
evenly divisible by four, your final payment amount may be smaller). The
three subsequent payments will be charged in the increments you selected
as part of your subscription plan. No interest or finance charges apply to
this installment plan purchase. Any interest, finance charges or fees
assessed by the issuer of your Payment Method may still apply. You are
personally responsible for any applicable state, federal or other taxes that
may be associated with your purchase of Services unless noted otherwise.
You can choose to prepay your next scheduled payment or the full
remaining balance at any time by contacting Customer Care.
3. Hinge’s right to Terminate. If Hinge is not able to charge any payment to
your Payment Method, Hinge reserves the right to pursue any remedy that
is available to it, including the right to suspend or terminate your Hinge
subscription and/or Hinge account. You agree that Hinge and its affiliates
have no liability related to the exercise of these remedies.
4. Cancellation Policy. Except as otherwise set forth herein, your
subscription purchased through your installment plan will continue until
terminated, cancelled, or not renewed by you or Hinge , as further
described in this Agreement. If not terminated, cancelled, or not renewed,
your Membership will continue to renew with installment payments, until
you cancel or change your payment options, via your Account Settings. If
you cancel a subscription, you may continue to use the cancelled service
until the end of your then-current subscription term. The subscription will
not be renewed when your then-current term expires. If you cancel your
subscription prior to completing all payments due, unless otherwise
required by applicable law, the remaining balance of the subscription will
remain due and payable pursuant to the installment payment schedule you
agreed to.
9. ACCOUNT TERMINATION
If you no longer wish to use our Services, or if we terminate your account for any reason,
here's what you need to know.
You can delete your account at any time by logging into the App, going to the “Profile” tab, and
selecting “Settings” (the gear icon), and following the instructions to terminate your
membership. However, you will need to cancel / manage any External Service Purchases
through your External Service Account (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store) to
avoid additional billing.
Hinge also reserves the right to review and, if appropriate, suspend, terminate, or ban your
account without a refund if Hinge believes that you have violated these Terms, misused our
Services, or behaved in a way that Hinge regards as inappropriate or unlawful, on or off our
Services, in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to make use of any personal,
technological, legal, or other means available to enforce the Terms, at any time without liability
and without the obligation to give you prior notice, including, but not limited to, preventing
you from accessing the Services.
You understand and agree that Hinge may not share information with you regarding your
account termination if doing so would potentially impair the safety or privacy of other users.
If your account is terminated by you or by Hinge for any reason, these Terms continue and
remain enforceable between you and Hinge, and you will not be entitled to any refund for
purchases made. Your information will be maintained, shared, and deleted in accordance
with our Privacy Policy.
10. NO CRIMINAL BACKGROUND OR IDENTITY VERIFICATION CHECKS
Hinge does not conduct criminal background or identity verification checks on its users.
Though Hinge strives to encourage a respectful user experience, it is not responsible for the
conduct of any user on or off the Service. Use your best judgment when interacting with
others and review our Safety Dating Advice.

BACKGROUND OR IDENTITY VERIFICATION CHECKS ON ITS USERS OR
OTHERWISE INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ITS USERS. HINGE MAKES

HEALTH, PHYSICAL CONDITION, INTENTIONS, LEGITIMACY, OR VERACITY OF

HINGE TO CONDUCT - ANY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER
SCREENINGS (SUCH AS SEX OFFENDER REGISTER SEARCHES) AT ANY TIME
USING AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS, AND YOU AGREE THAT ANY
INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE MAY BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE. IF THE
COMPANY DECIDES TO CONDUCT ANY SCREENING THROUGH A CONSUMER
REPORTING AGENCY, YOU HEREBY AUTHORIZE THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN AND
USE A CONSUMER REPORT ABOUT YOU TO DETERMINE YOUR ELIGIBILITY
UNDER THESE TERMS.
YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER

13. ADS AND THIRD-PARTY CONTENT
Like many subscription-based services, there are ads on our Services.
Our Services may contain advertisements and promotions offered by third parties and links to
other websites or resources. In addition, our Services may allow you to watch an advertisement
in exchange for Virtual Items; Hinge does not guarantee that you will always be eligible to
watch such advertisements, or that any such advertisements will be available. Hinge may also
provide non-commercial links or references to third parties within its content. Hinge is not
responsible for the availability (or lack of availability) of any external websites or resources or
their content. Furthermore, Hinge is not responsible for, and does not endorse, any products or
services that may be offered by third-party websites or resources. If you choose to interact with
the third parties made available through our Services, such party's terms will govern their
relationship with you. Hinge is not responsible or liable for such third parties' terms or actions.
14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Hinge's liability is limited to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
HINGE, ITS AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS, OR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, FIXED, OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,
OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES,
RESULTING FROM: (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR
USE THE SERVICES, (II) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY USERS (INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONTENT DEFINED ABOVE AS 'MEMBER CONTENT' OR
'YOUR CONTENT') OR THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES’
SERVICES OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES; OR (III) ANY
UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF
HINGE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL HINGE'S
AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES
EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO HINGE FOR THE SERVICES
DURING THE TWENTY-FOUR (24) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE
DATE THAT YOU FIRST FILE A LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL
PROCEEDING AGAINST HINGE, WHETHER STATUTORY, IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN
ANY TRIBUNAL. THE DAMAGES LIMITATION SET FORTH IN THE IMMEDIATELY
PRECEDING SENTENCE APPLIES (i) REGARDLESS OF THE GROUND UPON WHICH
LIABILITY IS BASED (WHETHER DEFAULT, CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, OR
OTHERWISE), (ii) IRRESPECTIVE OF THE TYPE OF BREACH OF RIGHTS,
PRIVILEGES, OR OBLIGATIONS, AND (iii) WITH RESPECT TO ALL EVENTS, THE
SERVICE, AND THIS AGREEMENT.
THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 14
SHALL APPLY EVEN IF YOUR REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FAIL WITH
RESPECT TO THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES,
SO SOME OR ALL OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO
YOU.
15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION
In the unlikely event that we have a legal dispute, here is how the Parties agree to proceed,
except where prohibited by applicable law.
15a. INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS
If you are dissatisfied with our Services for any reason, please contact Hinge Customer Service
at hello@hinge.co first so we can try to resolve your concerns without the need of outside
assistance. If you choose to pursue a dispute, claim or controversy against Hinge, these terms
will apply. For purposes of this Dispute Resolution Process and Arbitration Procedures set forth
in Section 15, “Hinge” shall include our affiliates, employees, licensors, and service providers.
Hinge values its relationship with you and appreciates the mutual benefit realized from informally
resolving Disputes. “Dispute” is any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Hinge that
arises from or relates in any way to this Agreement (including any alleged breach of this
Agreement), the Service, or our relationship with you. “Dispute” as used in this Agreement shall
have the broadest possible meaning and include claims that arose before the existence of this or
any prior Agreement, claims that arise during the term of this Agreement, and claims that arise
after the termination of this Agreement (unless this Agreement is superseded by a subsequent
Agreement entered into by you and Hinge).
If you have a Dispute with Hinge (“Your Dispute”), before formally pursuing Your Dispute in
arbitration or small claims court, you agree to first (send a detailed notice (“Notice”) to CT
Corporation, c/o Hinge, 1209 Orange Street, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware
19801, USA. However, if Your Dispute includes individual claims covered by the Ending Forced
Arbitration of Sexual Harassment Act, then you are not required to send a Notice before pursuing
your claims in accordance with Section 17. Your Notice must contain all of the following
information: (1) your full name; (2) information that enables Hinge to identify your account,
including a picture or screenshot of your profile, your address, mobile phone number, email
address, and date of birth you used to register your account if any; and (3) a detailed description of
your Dispute, including the nature and factual basis of your claim(s) and the relief you are seeking
with a corresponding calculation of your alleged damages (if any). You must personally sign this
Notice for it to be effective.
If Hinge has a Dispute with you (“Hinge’s Dispute”), Hinge agrees to first send a Notice to you at
your most recent email address on file with us, or if no email address is on file, other contact
information associated through your account. Hinge’s Dispute Notice must likewise set forth a
detailed description of Hinge’s Dispute, which shall include the nature and factual basis of its
claim(s) and the relief it is seeking, with a corresponding calculation of our damages (if any).
You and Hinge agree to then negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the Dispute. As part of
these good faith negotiations, Hinge may request a telephone conference with you to discuss Your
Dispute, and you agree to personally participate, with your attorney if you’re represented by
counsel. Likewise, you may request a telephone conference to discuss Hinge’s Dispute with you,
and Hinge agrees to have one representative participate. (For the avoidance of doubt, if you
submit a Notice relating to Hinge’s termination of your account, as set forth in Section 4 above,
such Dispute is not Hinge’s Dispute with you.)
This informal process should lead to a resolution of the Dispute. However, if the Dispute is not
resolved within 60 days after receipt of a fully completed Notice and the Parties have not
otherwise mutually agreed to an extension of this informal dispute resolution time period, you or
Hinge may initiate an arbitration (subject to a Party’s right to elect small claims court as provided
below). Completion of this informal dispute resolution is a condition precedent to filing any
demand for arbitration or small claims court action (except to the extent the Ending Forced
Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act precludes arbitration of disputes of
claims). Failure to do so is a breach of this Agreement. The statute of limitations and any filing
fee deadlines will be tolled while you and Hinge engage in this informal dispute resolution
process. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider, National Arbitration and
Mediation (“NAM”), shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall
administratively close any arbitration unless the Party bringing such demand for arbitration can
certify in writing that the terms and conditions of this informal dispute resolution process were
fully satisfied. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this provision and
to enjoin any arbitration proceeding or small claims court action accordingly.
All offers, promises, conduct, and statements made in the course of the informal dispute
resolution process by any party, its agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential and not
admissible for any purpose in any subsequent proceeding (except to the extent required to certify
in writing that the Party met the requirements of this informal dispute resolution process before
commencing a NAM arbitration), provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or
discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable.
15b. INDIVIDUAL RELIEF: CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, YOU AND HINGE EACH WAIVE
THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES IN
COURT IN FAVOR OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE
“ENDING FORCED ARBITRATION OF SEXUAL ARBITRATION OF SEXUAL
ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARRASSMENT ACT” PRECLUDES ARBITRATION OF
DISPUTES OR CLAIMS). YOU AND HINGE EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO FILE OR
PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER OR OTHERWISE TO
SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS, INCLUDING ANY CURRENTLY PENDING
ACTIONS AGAINST HINGE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW,
THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE
ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE,
CONSOLIDATED, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. THE ARBITRATOR
CAN AWARD THE SAME RELIEF AVAILABLE IN COURT PROVIDED THAT THE
ARBITRATOR MAY ONLY AWARD FINAL RELIEF (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE OR
DECLARATORY RELIEF) IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING
RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FINAL RELIEF
WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY
NOT AWARD FINAL RELIEF FOR, AGAINST, OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS
NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE,
REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. IF A COURT
DETERMINES THAT ANY OF THESE PROHIBITIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE
UNENFORCEABLE AS TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF
(SUCH AS A REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF), AND ALL APPEALS OF
THAT DECISION ARE AFFIRMED AND SUCH DECISION BECOMES FINAL, THEN
YOU AND HINGE AGREE THAT THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR
RELIEF SHALL PROCEED IN COURT BUT SHALL BE STAYED PENDING
INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS FOR RELIEF THAT
YOU HAVE BROUGHT. IF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS FOUND TO BE
UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION
(EXCEPT FOR THE JURY TRIAL WAIVER AND THE INFORMAL DISPUTE
RESOLUTION PROCESS) SHALL BE NULL AND VOID. THIS PARAGRAPH IS AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
15c. DISPUTE RESOLUTION THROUGH ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS
COURT
Any Dispute (that is not resolved informally by Hinge Customer Service or the informal dispute
resolution process as provided under subsection 15a above) shall be exclusively resolved through
BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION except for the following types of Disputes:
1. Disputes that are within the jurisdiction of a small claims court.
Either you or Hinge may elect to have an individual claim heard in small claims court. If
the request to proceed in small claims court is made after an arbitration has been initiated
but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration shall be administratively closed
by the arbitration provider (e.g., NAM). No determinations made by a small claims court
shall have preclusive effect in any proceeding involving Hinge and anyone other than you.
In the event such small claims court specifically determines that it is without jurisdiction to
hear the Dispute, you and Hinge shall arbitrate the Dispute under the terms of this
Agreement. In the event the small claims court retains jurisdiction over certain claims,
those claims will proceed in small claims court first. If there are additional claims not
within the small claims court’s jurisdiction, you and Hinge shall arbitrate the remaining
claims of the Dispute under the terms of this Agreement.
Disputes about whether a Dispute is within the jurisdiction of small claims court.
Any controversy regarding the small claims court’s jurisdiction shall be exclusively
determined by such small claims court. If the small claims court is unable or unwilling to
resolve such controversy, disagreements about whether a Dispute is within the jurisdiction
of a small claims court may otherwise be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction. If
you or Hinge challenges the small claims court election in your Dispute, and a court of
competent jurisdiction determines that the small claims court election is unenforceable,
then such election shall be severed from this Agreement as to your Dispute. However, such
court determination shall not be considered or deemed binding or have preclusive effect
with respect to any proceeding involving Hinge and anyone other than you.
2. Disputes covered by the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual
Harassment Act.
These claims can be brought in accordance with Section 17.
3. Disputes in certain jurisdictions.
Any Subsection in this Dispute Resolution Section that is prohibited by law shall not apply
to the users residing in that jurisdiction, including Subsections 15b, 15c, 15d, and 15e,
which shall not apply to users residing within the EU, EEA, UK, or Switzerland. The
online dispute settlement platform of the European Commission is available under
https://consumer-redress.ec.europa.eu/index_en. Hinge does not take part in dispute
settlement procedures in front of a consumer arbitration entity for users residing in the EU,
EEA, UK, or Switzerland.
All other issues (except as otherwise provided herein) are exclusively for the Arbitrator to decide,
including but not limited to scope and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Section, such as
questions of arbitrability, any request to proceed in small claims court that is made after an
arbitrator has been appointed, and any dispute as to whether either Party is in breach or default of
the Dispute Resolution Section or has explicitly or implicitly waived the right to arbitrate
Any court proceeding to enforce this Dispute Resolution Section 15, including any proceeding to
confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, must be commenced in accordance with Section
17. In the event Dispute Resolution Section 15 is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any
litigation against Hinge (except for small claims court actions) may be commenced only in the
federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas. You hereby irrevocably consent to those
courts’ exercise of personal jurisdiction over you for such purposes and waive any claim that such
courts constitute an inconvenient forum.
15d. INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND MASS ARBITRATION PROTOCOLS
This subsection 15d applies to Disputes that are submitted to NAM for arbitration after fully
completing the informal dispute resolution process described in subsection 15a above and when
no small claims court election is made by you or Hinge. Any arbitration between you and Hinge
shall be administered by NAM in accordance with NAM’s operative Comprehensive Dispute
Resolution Rules and Procedures (the “NAM Rules”) in effect at the time any demand for
arbitration is filed with NAM, as modified by this Dispute Resolution Section 15. For a copy of
the NAM Rules, please visit https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms or contact
NAM at NAM’s National Processing Center at 990 Stewart Avenue, 1
st Floor, Garden City, NY
11530 or at email address at commercial@namadr.com. If NAM is unable or unwilling to
perform its duties under this Agreement, the Parties shall mutually agree on an alternative
administrator that will replaceNAM and assume NAM’s role consistent with this Agreement and
this Agreement will govern to the extent it conflicts with the arbitration provider’s rules. If the
Parties are unable to agree, they will petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an
arbitration provider who will assume NAM’s duties under this Agreement. This Agreement will
govern to the extent it conflicts with any arbitration provider’s rules.
The Parties agree that the following procedures will apply to any Arbitrations initiated under this
Dispute Resolution Section (subject to either Party’s small claims court election as described
above):
1. Commencing an Arbitration – To initiate an arbitration, you or Hinge shall send to NAM
a demand for arbitration (“Demand for Arbitration”) that describes the claim(s) and request
for relief in detail, consistent with the requirements in this Agreement and the NAM Rules.
If you send a Demand for Arbitration, you shall also send it to CT Corporation, c/o Hinge,
1209 Orange Street, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19801, USA,
within 7 days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration to NAM. If Hinge sends a Demand
for Arbitration, we will also send it to your mailing address on file with us within the same
7-day period. If your mailing address is unavailable, we will send it to your email address
on file, or if no email address is on file, other contact information associated with your
account. The arbitration provider shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration
and shall administratively close any such demand for arbitration that fails to certify in
writing that the Party meets the requirements of Dispute Resolution Section 15 or if either
Party elects small claims court as set forth above.
2. Fees – The payment of NAM fees shall be governed by the NAM Rules, except to the
extent that the case is a part of a Mass Filing (as defined below) or the NAM fees and costs
(including Arbitrator fees) paid by either Party are reallocated upon order of the Arbitrator
following a determination that (a) either Party breached Section 15 of this Agreement, (b)
such reallocation is called for under this Agreement, or (c) reallocation is otherwise
permitted under applicable law. Upon a showing to Hinge of your financial hardship we
will consider a good faith request made by you to pay your portion of the applicable
consumer portion of the filing fee. Hinge is committed to ensuring that arbitration costs to
consumers do not serve as a barrier to the adjudication of disputes. If Hinge initiates an
arbitration against you, we shall pay all NAM fees.
3. The Arbitrator – The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator (the
“Claim Arbitrator”), as assisted by any Procedural Arbitrator appointed under the NAM
Rules. (The term “Arbitrator” applies to both the Claim Arbitrator and the Procedural
Arbitrator). If a hearing is elected by either Party, the Arbitrator shall be in or close to the
location in which you reside. The Arbitrator is bound by and shall adhere to this
Agreement. In the event NAM Rules conflict with this Agreement, the terms of this
Agreement shall control. If the Arbitrator determines that strict application of any term of
Section 15 of this Agreement (except for the small claims election, which shall be
determined by the small claims court) would result in a fundamentally unfair arbitration
(the “Unfair Term”), then the Arbitrator shall have authority to modify the Unfair Term to
the extent necessary to ensure a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the
Terms of Use (the “Modified Term”). In determining the substance of a Modified Term, the
Arbitrator shall select a term that comes closest to expressing the intention of the Unfair
Term.
4. Dispositive Motions – The Parties agree that the Claim Arbitrator shall have the authority
to consider dispositive motions without an oral evidentiary hearing. Dispositive motions
may be requested under the following circumstances: (a) within 30 days after the Claim
Arbitrator’s appointment, a Party may request to file a dispositive motion based upon the
pleadings; and (b) no later than 30 days prior to the evidentiary hearing, a Party may
request to file a dispositive motion for summary judgment based upon the Parties’
pleadings and the evidence submitted.
5. Arbitrator Selection – To select an arbitrator, NAM shall forward to the parties identical
lists containing 5 potential arbitrators. After receipt of the list, each party may strike up to
2 names from the list. The parties shall number the remaining names on the list in the
order of their preference and return the list to the NAM administrator within 15 days of
service of the document.
6. Discovery – Each Party may (a) serve up to five requests for relevant, non-privileged
documents from the other Party; and (b) request that the other Party provide verified
responses to no more than 5 relevant interrogatories (including subparts). Unless both
Parties agree otherwise, no other forms of discovery (including depositions) may be
utilized. Any such discovery requests must be served on the other Party within 21 days
after the Claim Arbitrator’s appointment. The responding Party shall provide the requesting
Party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, responses signed by the Party
themselves to the requested interrogatories, and/or any objections to the requests within 30
days after receipt of the requests, or, in the event of an objection to any discovery request,
30 days after the Claim Arbitrator resolves the dispute. In the event either Party requests
that the Claim Arbitrator consider a dispositive motion on the pleadings, such written
discovery response deadlines shall be extended until 30 days following the Claim
Arbitrator’s final decision on such dispositive motion. If after meeting and conferring the
Parties cannot agree on a dispute about discovery or a request for extension, that matter
shall be submitted promptly to the Claim Arbitrator for resolution. In ruling on any
discovery matter, the Claim Arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount, and
scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort that would be involved
in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule, and the extent to which the
requested discovery is truly necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense,
and NAM’s goal of efficient and economical resolutions. The burden of establishing good
cause for any additional discovery is on the moving Party.
7. Confidentiality – Upon either Party’s request, the Arbitrator will issue an order requiring
that confidential information of either Party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in
documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration
or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of
confidential information must be done under seal.
8. Arbitration Hearing – You and Hinge are entitled to a fair evidentiary hearing (i.e. trial)
before the Claim Arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings are usually simpler, less costly, and
more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. The Parties agree to waive all
oral hearings and instead submit all disputes to the Claim Arbitrator for an award based on
written submissions and other evidence as the Parties may agree, unless a Party requests an
oral hearing within 10 days after the Respondent files a response. If an oral evidentiary
hearing is requested, both Parties must personally attend the hearing, regardless of whether
either Party has retained counsel. Either Party’s failure to personally attend the hearing,
without a continuance ordered by the Claim Arbitrator for good cause, will result in a
default judgment taken against that Party.
9. Arbitration Award – Regardless of the format of the arbitration, the Claim Arbitrator shall
provide a reasoned decision, in writing within 30 days after the hearing or, if no hearing is
held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due. The decision
must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the reasons
for the award. The arbitration award is binding only between you and Hinge and will not
have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different
Party. The Claim Arbitrator may, however, choose to consider rulings from other
arbitrations involving a different Party. The Arbitrator may award fees and costs as
provided by the NAM Rules or to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded in
court. This includes but is not limited to the ability of the Arbitrator to award fees,costs, or
sanctions against a Party or its representative(s) if the Arbitrator determines that a claim or
defense is frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose, for the purpose of
harassment, or in bad faith.
10. Offer of Settlement – The Respondent may, but is not obligated to, make a written
settlement offer to the opposing Party any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a
dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount
or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the Claim Arbitrator until after the
Claim Arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the opposing
Party’s favor and is less than the Respondent’s settlement offer or if the award is in the
Respondent’s favor, the opposing Party must pay the Respondent’s costs incurred after the
offer was made, including any attorney’s fees. If any law prohibits shifting arbitration fees
or costs, any rejected or lapsed offer under this provision shall be deemed to halt the
claimant’s accrual of recoverable costs under the asserted cause of action.
11. Mass Filing – If, at any time, 25 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted
against Hinge or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (“Mass
Filing”), consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings set forth in the NAM’s
Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (“NAM’s Mass Filing
Rules”, available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), the additional
protocols set forth below shall apply.
i. If you or your counsel file a Demand for Arbitration that fits within the
definition of Mass Filing referred to above, then you agree that your
Demand for Arbitration shall be subject to the additional protocols set forth
in this Mass Filing subsection. You also acknowledge that the adjudication
of your Dispute might be delayed and that any applicable statute of
limitations shall be tolled from the time at which the first Demands are
chosen to proceed until your Demand is chosen for a bellwether
proceeding.
ii. NAM’s Mass Filing Rules shall apply if your Dispute is deemed by NAM,
in its sole discretion pursuant to its Rules and this Dispute Resolution
Section, to be part of a Mass Filing. Such election for NAM’s Mass Filing
Rules and related fee schedule must be made by either you or Hinge in
writing and submitted to NAM and all Parties.
Bellwether Proceedings. Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by
courts and arbitration administrators when there are multiple disputes
involving similar claims against the same or related parties. For the
first set of bellwether proceedings, counsel for the Mass Filings
claimants (including you) and counsel for Hinge shall each select 15
Demands for Arbitration (30 total) to proceed, and no more than those
30 arbitrations shall be filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending at such
time, with each of the 30 individual arbitrations presided over by a
different Claim Arbitrator. During this time, no other Demands for
Arbitration that are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed,
adjudicated, or pending. If the Parties are unable to resolve the
remaining Demands for Arbitration after the first set of bellwether
proceedings are arbitrated or otherwise resolved, then the Parties will
continue to engage in the bellwether proceedings for an additional
four (4) rounds, increasing the amount of Demands for Arbitration
selected by counsel for each Party by five (5) with each round, so that
during the second round, counsel for the Claimants and counsel for
Hinge shall each select an additional 20 Demands for Arbitration (40
total), in the third round, 25 each (50 total), in the fourth round, 30
each (60 total), and in the fifth round 35 each (70 total). Within each
round, each of the individual arbitrations is to be presided over by a
different Claim Arbitrator, and during these additional rounds of the
bellwether proceedings, no other Demands for Arbitration that are
part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, or adjudicated once
selected by the Procedural Arbitrator. Following the first round of
bellwether proceedings, but before the second round of bellwether
proceedings, counsel for the Parties shall participate in a global
mediation, before a retired federal or state-court judge (unless the
Parties agree otherwise), with Hinge to pay the mediator’s fees.
Following the second, third, fourth, and fifth rounds of bellwether
proceedings, counsel for both parties should discuss additional
mediation and seek out opportunities to resolve the remaining
Demands for Arbitration, but will only proceed with mediation upon
consent of counsel for all Parties.
If the Parties are unable to resolve the remaining Demands for
Arbitration after the fifth set of bellwether proceedings are arbitrated
or otherwise resolved, and the Parties decide to not continue with
additional rounds of bellwether proceedings, then counsel for the
Claimants and counsel for Hinge shall discuss with NAM a fair process
for individually adjudicating the remaining Demands for Arbitration.
Under this process, the Procedural Arbitrator will make the final
decision on the number of Demands for Arbitration that can proceed
individually at any time, as well as a method for selecting which
Demands for Arbitration will proceed, taking into account the number
of individual arbitrations that counsel for Claimants and counsel for
Hinge are able to reasonably manage at the same time, as well as the
number of individual arbitrations that NAM is able to administer. A
Demand for Arbitration that was not included in the bellwethering
process will only be deemed filed, processed, or adjudicated once
selected by the Procedural Arbitrator. At any time after the first set of
Demands for Arbitration are resolved (30 Demands for Arbitration
total), the Parties may agree to forgo the bellwether proceedings for any
additional Demands for Arbitration deemed to be part of the Mass
Filings. Fees associated with a Demand for Arbitration included in the
Mass Filings, including fees owed by Hinge and the Claimants
(including you), shall only be due after the Demand for Arbitration is
chosen to proceed as part of a set of bellwether proceedings, or after
being selected by the Procedural Arbitrator to proceed upon completion
of the bellwether proceedings, and therefore properly designated for
filing, processing, and adjudication. The Parties are encouraged to meet
and confer throughout this process regarding ways
to streamline the proceedings, including discussion of potential ways to
increase the number of Demands for Arbitration to be adjudicated in
sets of staged bellwether proceedings. Either Party may negotiate with
NAM as to reducing and deferring fees and streamlining procedures. If
you are a Mass Filing claimant, any applicable statute of limitations (or
other applicable limitations period) shall be tolled beginning when you
initiate the informal dispute resolution process set forth in subsection
15a of the Agreement, and if the first Mass Filings’ Demands for
Arbitration that are chosen for the initial set of bellwether proceedings
have been filed, your claims will remain tolled until your Demand for
Arbitration is either selected by counsel for the Parties in the bellwether
proceedings or selected by the Procedural Arbitrator following
completion of the bellwether proceedings. A court of competent
jurisdiction located in a venue allowed under Section 17 of the
Agreement shall have the power to enforce this subsection.
iii. You and Hinge agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of the
arbitration and small claims court process and wish to employ the process
for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and
Hinge acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the fair
resolution of genuine and sincere Disputes. The Parties further agree that
application of these Mass Filings procedures have been reasonably designed
to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such Disputes.
15e. FUTURE CHANGES AND RETROACTIVE APPLICATION
This Dispute Resolution Section 15 applies to all Disputes between the Parties, including for any
claims that accrued against you or Hinge prior to the time of your consent to this Agreement and
to any claims that accrue against you or Hinge after your consent to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you may elect to opt out of the
retroactive application of this Dispute Resolution Section 15 as to claims that have accrued
against you or against Hinge prior to the time of your consent to this Agreement. You may opt out
by sending us written notice, within 30 days of the time you consent to this Agreement, to the
following email address: OptOut@hinge.co. Please do not direct any customer support inquiries
OptOut@hinge.co, as they will not be addressed; such inquiries should be directed to Customer

such as the email address or phone number associated with your account(s), and should include a
statement that you are opting out of the retroactive application of this Dispute Resolution Section
15. Please note: if you opt out of the retroactive application of this Dispute Resolution Section 15,
you will still be subject to and bound by any Dispute Resolution Sections and Arbitration
Procedures you previously agreed to, including any arbitration provisions, class action waivers,
and retroactive application sections. Also, regardless of whether you opt out of the retroactive
application of these changes, the Parties will resolve any claims that accrue against you or Hinge
after your consent to this Agreement in accordance with this Dispute Resolution Section.
16. GOVERNING LAW
Texas law and the Federal Arbitration Act will apply to any Dispute (except where
prohibited by law).
You understand and acknowledge that Hinge maintains its principal place of business in Dallas,
Texas. You agree that the Services, this Agreement, and all Disputes, including but not limited

any Dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or our Services, and the Dispute
Resolution Process set forth in Section 15 shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
Both parties agree that this choice of law agreement is enforceable and waives the right to
have a court conduct a conflicts of law analysis.
In the EU and EEA, the choice of Texas governing law shall not apply only where a mandatory
consumer protection law explicitly prohibits such choice of law provisions.
17. VENUE/FORUM SELECTION

be litigated in Dallas County, Texas (except for claims filed in small claims court, or for users
residing in the EU, EEA, UK or Switzerland or another jurisdiction where prohibited by law).
Except where prohibited by law, including for users residing in the EU, EEA, UK or
Switzerland, who may bring claims in their country of residence in accordance with applicable
law, and except for claims that are heard in a small claims court as set forth in Section 15, any
claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any challenges to the class action
waiver provision in subsection 15b), to our Services, or to your relationship with Hinge that for
whatever reason are not required to be arbitrated or filed in small claims court, will be litigated
exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas, U.S.A. You and Hinge
